## Developing steps

* **TODO**

### Branches

The process of adding new functionality begins by creating a new branch for development, branching from the `develop` branch. The name prefix for the branch is selected based on the type of added functionality:

* `feat` ─ adding new user features
* `fix` ─ fixing bugs
* `chore` ─ adding / updating new features that with doesn't affect user code. Example, optimizing package builds, code rules and etc
* `docs` - documentation

Then comes the `/` character and a short associative name in `kebab-case`.

So, for example, the name of the branch for adding the change new header may have the name: `feat/new-header`.

### Commits

Comments to commits are formatted to the following rule:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

#### Type

* `feat` - using for adding new feature
* `fix` - fixing some bug
* `docs` - add or update docs
* `test` - add or update tests for app
* `chore` - optimizing package builds, code rules and etc

#### Scope

Here you must specify which areas were affected commit. Example: `(header)` or `(button)`

#### Subject

Common style message:

```
action (with lower case) + for which entity + (optional details)
```

For example:
```
fix margin in button
```

#### Examples

```
feat(footer): add phone in contact
fix(modal): fix shadow for modal
chore(next-config): add rewrite for redirect in next config
```

### Pull Requests

The development process ends with a Pull Request of the development branch in the `develop` branch on [github.com](https://github.com/MargoRSq/instify).
* If the `develop` branch has gone ahead during development, it is necessary to `rebase` from it.
